# MemoryApp

This web application is a memory game created in React JS. The application is broken down into different UI components that change state based on user input. A set of 10 cards will be rendered to the UI for every round of the game. The user needs to click on a different image each round, without repeating images. If the user clicks on a color that has already been visited, the user will lose and the game will be reset. The current score and top score of all rounds will be displayed in the top of the page.
